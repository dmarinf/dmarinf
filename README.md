- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmarinf
- 👀 I’m interested in python and Solidity right now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and Solidity.
- 💞️ I’m yet not looking to collaborate on anything at this moment, as I'm refreshing my coding skills, as I used to be a developer 20+ years ago (I'm a Test Manager now).
- 📫 Just drop me a msg.
